# Motion Powered Games Development Plan

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an interactive video chat application where users can engage in various motion-based games while being represented by customizable avatars. The application will use computer vision to track players' movements, gestures, and facial expressions, translating them into in-game actions. Players can choose from multiple game modes, each offering unique gameplay experiences based on different motion mechanics. The focus is on epic battles, magical spellcasting, and other immersive experiences that transform physical movements into powerful in-game actions.

## Stretch Goals

### 1. Enhanced Gameplay
- Multiple game modes beyond basic boxing
- Tournament system for competitive play
- Team-based matches (2v2 or more)
- Training mode with AI opponents
- Special move system with complex gesture combinations
- Naruto-style hand gesture sequences that trigger special effects
  * Require completion of three or more specific motions in sequence
  * Trigger visual animations with particle effects
  * Include accompanying sound effects
  * Different gesture combinations for different special moves

### 2. Advanced Avatar Features
- More detailed customization options
- Unlockable avatar items through gameplay
- Avatar animations for victory/defeat sequences
- Physics-based clothing and hair simulation

### 3. Social Features
- Spectator mode for watching matches
- Clip sharing of highlight moments
- In-game chat or quick communication system
- Integration with social platforms

### 4. Monetization Options
- Premium avatar skins or customization options
- Battle pass system with seasonal rewards
- Ad-supported free tier with premium subscription option

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Video Chat
- ✓ Implement basic video chat functionality
- ✓ Set up user authentication
- ✓ Create simple UI framework

### Phase 2: Avatar and Motion Tracking
- Develop avatar overlay system
- Implement basic motion tracking
- Create character selection interface

### Phase 3: Game Mechanics
- Build boxing mechanics and health system
- Implement hit detection and damage calculation
- Create match flow (rounds, timers, results)

### Phase 4: Polish and Additional Features
- Refine user experience and interface
- Add social features and progression systems
- Optimize performance and fix bugs

### Phase 5: Testing and Launch
- Conduct thorough testing across different devices
- Soft launch with limited user base
- Gather feedback and implement improvements
- Full public release

## Technical Stack Considerations
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with possible frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- Backend: Python/Node.js for server-side logic
- Computer Vision: TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe, or custom ML models
- Real-time Communication: WebRTC, Socket.io
- Rendering: Three.js or Pixi.js for avatar visualization
- Database: MongoDB/PostgreSQL for user data and match history

## Development Behavior Expectations

### Code Quality and Organization
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code; refactor at that point
- Avoid duplication of code by checking for similar functionality elsewhere in the codebase
- Always prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality

### Development Workflow
- After making changes, ALWAYS start up a new server for testing
- Always kill all existing related servers before starting a new one
- Always look for existing code to iterate on instead of creating new code
- Do not drastically change patterns before trying to iterate on existing ones
- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task

### Environment Considerations
- Write code that takes into account different environments: dev, test, and prod
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects dev or prod environments
- Never overwrite .env files without first asking and confirming

### Change Management
- Be careful to only make changes that are requested or are well understood
- When fixing issues, exhaust all options with existing implementations before introducing new patterns
- If introducing a new pattern, remove the old implementation to avoid duplicate logic
- Avoid making major changes to patterns and architecture after a feature works well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always consider what other methods and areas of code might be affected by changes
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once
